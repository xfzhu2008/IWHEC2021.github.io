                                        Empathy and Symbiosis: Design preferable future AI product and service</h4>
                                    <p class="text-justify font-zoom-out"><strong>Abstract:</strong> The future of AI
                                        product and service design will reshape the relationship of people, community
                                        and environment. As an increasingly powerful technology, AI also prompt the
                                        design researcher and practitioner to rethink the harmonious coexistence of
                                        technology, society and culture. Human-Centred Design and Human-computer
                                        symbiosis also become an important field and direction of HCI and design
                                        research. Empathy is crucial to a human-centred design process, and helps design
                                        thinker to place himself in user's position to gain insight of motivation,
                                        behaviors and experiences. Symbiosis explores the optimal and ideal role of
                                        human beings in human-machine systems, and construct the sustainable
                                        relationship to achieve mutualism. The application of AI in HCI and design
                                        field, leads the transformation of design processes and methods. Designers and
                                        researchers need to re-examine the ethical and emotional factors of future AI
                                        application scenarios with empathy perspective. In the future, AI will be a
                                        partner of designer, AI will work with designers to create a preferable future
                                        with new methods and tools that complement the brain-machine advantage. Based on
                                        Human-engaged Computing methodology, this presentation will explore the social
                                        needs and cultural experiences of future smart city and society, using
                                        speculative thinking, futuristic concepts and design fiction methods, to discuss
                                        how to design the preferable AI product and service for future scenarios, and
                                        achieve a harmonious goal of empathy with human, and symbiosis with nature.

                                        “Knowledge Embodied in Artifacts”: A Problem in Design Epistemology</h4>
                                    <p class="text-justify font-zoom-out"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Among the most
                                        exciting developments in HCI research today is the rise of designerly approaches
                                        to research: research through design, practice-based research, constructive
                                        design, etc. In a 1994 article seeking to establish such an agenda, Christopher
                                        Frayling used the provocative phrase, “knowledge embodied in artifacts,” to
                                        capture this research’s defining feature. As the HCI community has discovered,
                                        however, understanding, accessing, and legitimating “knowledge embodied in
                                        artifacts” has been challenging. It is not always clear how highly
                                        particularized objects are supposed to generalize, how they contribute to theory
                                        development, or how they might be applied by others.
                                        <br>
                                        <br>
                                        I argue that practitioners of these approaches have often shoehorned their work
                                        into social scientific frameworks of rigor, validity, and generalizability.
                                        Instead, design-oriented HCI researchers should pursue a more expansive
                                        understanding of “HCI research” to support “knowledge embodied in artifacts” as
                                        a mode of design research. So, rather than locating intellectual validity and
                                        generalizability in propositions, formal arguments, and theoretical paraphrase,
                                        we should locate them literally as they are embodied in artifacts themselves.
                                        This entails engaging designed artifacts as such, that is, analytically
                                        understanding features such as intertextuality (quoting, references, allusions),
                                        concrete universals (such as design patterns), themes and variations, and
                                        polysemy (semantic density, allegory, satire). All of that in turn presupposes
                                        new modes of presenting design-oriented HCI research, a process already begun
                                        with Pictorials.

                                        to Menopause Wellness</h4>
                                    <p class="text-justify font-zoom-out"><strong>Abstract: </strong>Menopause signifies
                                        the end of a woman’s reproductive ability. Usually starting in a woman’s late
                                        40s or early 50s, the menopausal transition is a major life phase affecting
                                        roughly half of the population, resulting in physiological, emotional, and
                                        social changes. Menopause is commonly understood as a personal women’s health
                                        issue and examined through the lens of clinical medical research, and design
                                        approaches typically reflect such an orientation. Yet there are dimensions of
                                        menopause that are not best understood via medical paradigms. For example,
                                        menopause is also a political phenomenon, including matters of health equity as
                                        well as taboos and other social experiences of menopause.

                                        Increasingly, I am exploring Human Computer Interaction (HCI) and design for
                                        women’s health from a different perspective, that of feminist utopian theory and
                                        methods. Feminist utopianism seeks glimmers of radically better futures in
                                        partial and fragmentary forms in the present. It is a critical practice that is
                                        hopeful, materially engaged, and future-oriented—a strong fit for design. In
                                        this talk, I develop an approach of feminist utopian design featuring ongoing
                                        work that I’m doing with my collaborators on menopause. This includes results
                                        from our empirical research on women’s menopause discourses, which locates
                                        glimmers of possibility in the embodied experiences of the present. I will also
                                        present our design activities envisioning menopause experiences from a preferred
                                        future. The resulting feminist utopian design—integrating these empirical and
                                        design moves—are intended to advance a deliberative discourse about HCI and
                                        design’s roles—and responsibilities—in contributing to women’s health and
                                        wellness.

                                        Information Retrieval, particularly the design and use of voice search systems
                                        has been drawing significant attention during recent years. In this talk, I will
                                        address challenges and opportunities in voice search systems with the focus on
                                        improving the system capabilities and guiding the search process. I will also
                                        talk about a couple of related projects and their research findings and
                                        implications for voice search system design. Earlier research indicates that
                                        users of information systems employed voice search much less frequently than
                                        keyboard search because they disliked the system mistakes and the fact that they
                                        were unable to modify the queries. We found that in keyboard search, query
                                        reformulation is facilitated by partial query modification, which is not
                                        supported by most of the current voice search systems. Users need to speak
                                        complete query in voice search even with minor changes. We examined partial
                                        query modification during voice search, and then compared a system with partial
                                        query modification feature to a baseline system through a Wizard of OZ user
                                        experiment. The theoretical framework of Human Engaged Computing can help
                                        improve the search process of voice search systems, in particular providing the
                                        guidance of the dialogue between users and voice search systems. At the end, I
                                        will introduce a new journal called “Journal of Human Engaged Computing” we have
                                        been planning to launch.

                                        not passively accepting and processing information from the external
                                        environment. Rather, humans actively predict their perceptions and the
                                        consequences of their actions in real time. The success or failure of such
                                        predictions is known to have a great impact on the predictor's sense of agency
                                        and immersion in the environment. In this talk, I envision that in the age of
                                        human-engaged computing, computers are no longer simply reacting to user input,
                                        but must be synchronized with the user's real-time predictions. However, little
                                        HCI research has been conducted on the human-computer synchronization process.
                                        This talk introduces the latest theories and models related to the
                                        human-computer synchronization process, and then discusses the design of
                                        interfaces for human-engaged computing.

                                        Graduate School of Culture Technology. As a human-computer interaction
                                        researcher, he has focused on building user performance models in dynamic and
                                        synchronized interactions. His recent temporal pointing models (CHI'16, CHI'18,
                                        CHI'19), in particular, explain how a user determines a optimal timing of button
                                        input in response to rapidly changing computer states. As a result, the models
                                        showed new possibilities in the design and optimization of input techniques and

                                        the automated/autonomous driving are getting more and more attention from
                                        industry, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) plays very important role in this
                                        field. With the widespread application of intelligent functionalities in smart
                                        cars, the conflicts between human drivers and automated/autonomous driving besed
                                        on Artificial Intelligence has become increasingly prominent.

                                        Automated/autonomous driving relies on artificial intelligence algorithms that
                                        be constantly updated, but human drivers make behavioral decisions that do not
                                        simply rely on algorithm logic but also on social moral and ethical issues. How
                                        to make artificial intelligence truly think like a human with moral, ethical and
                                        other aspects of thinking? In this talk, we try to match different levels of
                                        Automated/autonomous driving intelligence with human driver’s different degree
                                        of awareness of artificial intelligence under different autonomous driving
                                        level, so that we will have a better performance of Collaborative Driving
                                        Synergized Interaction.

                                        Eye on/off and Hand on/off are always the key judgement of the intelligent
                                        driving levels. How to balance the behaviors of “intelligent driving” and human
                                        drivers are the key issues to ensure that collaborative driving synergistically.

                    <p>The international workshop on Human-Engaged Computing (IWHEC 2020) will be held at the Center for
                        Human-Engaged Computing (CHEC) at Kochi University of Technology in Japan on January 10th, 2020.
                    </p>
                    <p>Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are now playing significant roles in everyday
                        life. Human-Engaged Computing (HEC) concerns the way humans interact with ICTs and the impact
                        these technologies have on human lives, relationships, human potential and human capabilities.
                        This workshop is intended to become a platform for researchers with interest in ICTs and related
                        areas to exchange ideas, discuss on-going projects, and report research findings. </p>
                    <p>The short paper track invites submissions from all ICT areas in relation to the concept of
                        Human-Engaged Computing. Submissions will be judged on such criteria as creativity, design,
                        quality of content and presentation, and significance for theory. <i><strong>Some short papers
                                will be selected for recommending to submit a revised version to a professional journal
                                after the workshop.</strong></i> </p>
